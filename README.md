# IRWA FINAL PROJECT

## Project Part 1 Overview
The final project focuses on building a search and retrieval system for an e-commerce fashion products dataset.

3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
